# CIS-106---Brendan-Thompson

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because it is a requirement to graduate. The major I am pursuing is A:AS Web Development. Right now I'm not too sure where I want to end up in the field but I think that becoming a web developer and then branching out from there seems like the best option. 

## Assignment 2

The programming language I selected is JavaScript. The reason I selected JavaScript is because it is the next logical step in Web Development after HTML and CSS. I thought of it as a language just primarily used on web pages and would like to see what else I am capable of doing with it. I was going to use Python but decided that diving into tools that I will likely always be using is more important. I'm sure Python would be useful to know, but JavaScript takes priority in Web Development as far I know. The IDEs I decided to go with is Visual Studio Code. I was using Sublime Text 3 which I liked, but it isn't used as commonly and Visual Studio code has many more extensions and tools to use. 

## Assignment 3

For this assignment I learned a massive amount about JavaScript and Flowgorithm. But, in general I learned that programming is very selective with the syntax and order of what you write. For example, because JavaScript is mostly used in the background of webpages the default way to display text is with "window.alert". This doesn't work when using it as a stand-alone as far as I understand because there is no webpage, but simple a console for the inputs and outputs. Instead, I had to rely on the "console.log" command which isn't as commonly mentioned for displaying results. Combining Flowgorithm and JavaScript allowed me to understand how constants, variables, and operators work together to take data and give different results.

## Assignment 4

Assignment 4 functioned more as an extension of what I had to learn on assignment 3. I got a much better grasp on how to add variables into the string outputs to make the outputs seem more personal. I learned that navigating programs to keep them as simple as possible is important. For assignment 3 I tried to limit the user input to only numbers, but because of NaN it wouldn't allow for anything but integer and floats to be entered anyway! This means that if I use any variables in arithmetic, I don't necessarily have to worry about users inputting anything other than numbers. I will look more into how to only allow number inputs though.
