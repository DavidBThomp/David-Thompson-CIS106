# CIS-106---Brendan-Thompson

## Assignment 1

I'm taking this course because it is a requirement to graduate. The major I am pursuing is A:AS Web Development. Right now I'm not too sure where I want to end up in the field but I think that becoming a web developer and then branching out from there seems like the best option. 

## Assignment 2

The programming language I selected is JavaScript. The reason I selected JavaScript is because it is the next logical step in Web Development after HTML and CSS. I thought of it as a language just primarily used on web pages and would like to see what else I am capable of doing with it. I was going to use Python but decided that diving into tools that I will likely always be using is more important. I'm sure Python would be useful to know, but JavaScript takes priority in Web Development as far I know. The IDEs I decided to go with is Visual Studio Code. I was using Sublime Text 3 which I liked, but it isn't used as commonly and Visual Studio code has many more extensions and tools to use. 

## Assignment 3

For this assignment I learned a massive amount about JavaScript and Flowgorithm. But, in general I learned that programming is very selective with the syntax and order of what you write. For example, because JavaScript is mostly used in the background of webpages the default way to display text is with "window.alert". This doesn't work when using it as a stand-alone as far as I understand because there is no webpage, but simple a console for the inputs and outputs. Instead, I had to rely on the "console.log" command which isn't as commonly mentioned for displaying results. Combining Flowgorithm and JavaScript allowed me to understand how constants, variables, and operators work together to take data and give different results.

## Assignment 4

Assignment 4 functioned more as an extension of what I had to learn on assignment 3. I got a much better grasp on how to add variables into the string outputs to make the outputs seem more personal. I learned that navigating programs to keep them as simple as possible is important. For assignment 3 I tried to limit the user input to only numbers, but because of NaN it wouldn't allow for anything but integer and floats to be entered anyway! This means that if I use any variables in arithmetic, I don't necessarily have to worry about users inputting anything other than numbers. I will look more into how to only allow number inputs though. 

## Assignment 5

This assignment was especially difficult for me, even though it isn't completed on the first day. The JavaScript as I can tell is barely not working, but the flowgorithm does. I got help from Hasfsa Hussaini and will likely need help again on day 2. I don't think I'm making a connection on how parameters, functions, and variables interact with each other. I feel like I slightly understand the concepts but don't know how to place what where. After getting my parameters correct I have a much stronger grasp on functions. 

## Assignment 6

Once again it took me a bit longer to figure this out simply because I missed out on one parameter. I did learn that when storing values from calculations they must always be stored in a variable, while outputs can simply be printed because it won't have changing values. I did peer a little bit into arrays and how to get multiple variables back from one function, but didn't use it because that seems to be a bit more advanced and will be explained in later lessons. 

## Assignment 7

The concepts for assignment 7 aren't super complex to me, the idea of logic and "if-then" statements make sense. I think I'm having a bit of trouble understanding where to use these though. I learned that when making a program using these concepts can allow for much more complex programs to be made that are much more responsive. Instead of linear programs that are simple to break, we can now make programs that can respond to different inputs and give different outputs. I also learned how much more efficient doing this can be, essentially making some of the code used and some of not, will reduce the resources used by said program.


## Assignment 8

I learned that when programming using while loops are super useful tools. They can automate tasks such as gathering data from a user to creating data based on what a user inputs. I learned about changing what the variables mean in the loop in order to make to loop operational. We also used more boolean than before to define when the loop would continue or stop. This can be applied to create programs that run on a daily basis or even an hourly basis to automate the tasks that need to be done. The activity 2 JavaScript isn't completely functioning yet, I just can't get the total value of all the inputs.
